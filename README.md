# Ethan Dark Graduate Portfolio
A portfolio of all recent projects from my graduate program at CU Boulder.

### Agenda
1. SherLock vs. Moriarty
2. Gaming Console Competitors
3. Seagate
4. Hulu
5. Children's Hospital
6. AirBnB

## SherLock vs. Moriarty
This group project set out to look at data from a phone malware detection experiment and find trends to predict malicious sessions. My contribution included all of the data preparation and merging, as well as applying Pyspark ML functions to predict our problem.
The project and my contributed code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethandark310/EthanDarkPortfolio/tree/main/docs/SherLock%20vs.%20Moriarty%20Project).

## Gaming Console Competitors
This solo project set out to look at Twitter mentions through Twitter API for three separate gaming console competitors and run a network analysis on keywords and users.
The project and my contributed code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethandark310/EthanDarkPortfolio/tree/main/docs/Gaming%20Console%20Project).

## Seagate
This group project set out to look at data from Seagate hard drive production and find trends to predict failed hard drives. My contribution included all of the data preparation, as well as applying Pyspark ML functions to predict our problem and create clusters.
The project and my contributed code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethandark310/EthanDarkPortfolio/tree/main/docs/Seagate%20Project).

## Hulu
This group project set out to look at Google Trends data on Hulu and create a time series analysis. My contribution included all of the coding, as well as part of the research.
The project and my contributed code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethandark310/EthanDarkPortfolio/tree/main/docs/Hulu%20Project).

## Children's Hospital
This group project set out to look at data from Children's Hospital appointments and find trends to predict appointment volume and cancellation. My contribution included all of the data preparation, as well as running a time series model on data before and after covid.
The project and my contributed code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethandark310/EthanDarkPortfolio/tree/main/docs/Childrens%20Hospital%20Project).

## AirBnB
This group project set out to look at data from AirBnB listings and find trends to predict price. My contribution included all of the data preparation, as well as running a KNN Regression on each neighborhood group.
The project and my contributed code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethandark310/EthanDarkPortfolio/tree/main/docs/AirBnB%20Project).
